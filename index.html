            <h2>INTJ Introduction</h2>
            <h3>The INTJ personality type is known as “The Mastermind” or "The Architect"</h3>
            <p>
                INTJs, as introverts, are quiet, reserved, and comfortable being alone. They are usually self-sufficient and would rather
                work alone than in a group. Socializing drains an introvert’s energy, causing them to need to recharge.
            </p>
            <p>
                INTJs are interested in ideas and theories. When observing the world they are always questioning why things happen the way
                they do. They excel at developing plans and strategies, and don’t like uncertainty. They are insightful and
                quick to understand new ideas. They value intelligence, knowledge, and competence.

            <h2>Communication and Interaction Points</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    I strongly prefer to have a clear group task manager (myself or someone else).
                </li>
                <li>
                    I self-edit on the fly, so general goals are better than a full outline.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I struggle with taking feedback personally, but need it to improve.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Open communication is key to managing my stress levels.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I thrive when a group is fully invested in the progress.

<!-- Create a simple web page with HTML and CSS (no JS) with the following specs:
1. A heading with your personality type
2. An image representing the personality type
3. A brief description introducing the personality type
4. A list of the strengths and weaknesses for the personality type
5. At least five important points you want people who will be interacting and communicating with you to know(from your earlier group discussion)
6. Three famous personalities that share the same personality type
Each of you should make your own website, but you should hang out with your group and ask each other for help first. We'll be in a meeting from 12:45 - 1:45 or 2, but feel free to ask us for help outside that window! We'll check in with you this afternoon and see how it's going. Hopefully we'll have you present to another group late this afternoon! -->
