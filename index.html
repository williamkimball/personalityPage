<!-- Create a simple web page with HTML and CSS (no JS) with the following specs:
1. A heading with your personality type
2. An image representing the personality type
3. A brief description introducing the personality type
4. A list of the strengths and weaknesses for the personality type
5. At least five important points you want people who will be interacting and communicating with you to know(from your earlier group discussion)
6. Three famous personalities that share the same personality type
Each of you should make your own website, but you should hang out with your group and ask each other for help first. We'll be in a meeting from 12:45 - 1:45 or 2, but feel free to ask us for help outside that window! We'll check in with you this afternoon and see how it's going. Hopefully we'll have you present to another group late this afternoon! -->
